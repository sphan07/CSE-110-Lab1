My name is Samantha Phan. I am a Computer Science Major at UCSD. 

## Programming 
  
  I have been coding for about *2 years* now and I love learning new things. 

  **Programming Languages:**
  - Java
  - C++
  - Python 
    - (beginning level as I'm currently teaching my younger brother, hard stuff tho for 9 years old ~should've started from making Scratch games~ )
  
Although I know Python at a beginning level in order to teach small kids as one of my goals in life is to become a teacher.

# Code Snippet 

can't forget to leave a hello, world!
``` 
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```
